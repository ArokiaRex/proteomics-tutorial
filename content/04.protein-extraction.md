## Protein Extraction {.page_break_before}

First, proteins must be isolated from the sample matrix. Because some proteins alter other proteins, the goal is to simultaneously solubilizw and denature proteins. This is achieved with a combination of salt and chaotropic agent. 

1. Choice of Lysis buffer
* Urea can cause chemical modifications 
2. chemicals to avoid: PEGs, etc
3. removal of contaminations, Protein Precipitation
4. protein alkylation
* choices of reduction and alkylation reagents, TCEP/DTT/2BME, Chloroacetamide/iodoacetamide, n-ethyl maleimide
