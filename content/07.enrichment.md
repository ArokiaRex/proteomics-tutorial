## Peptide or Protein Enrichment

### Protein enrichment (e.g. for protein protein interactions)
The ligand induces molecular association/ protein-protein interaction. These interactions occur when two proteins directly interact with each other or when the proteins are present in complexes. It is also classified as direct or induced reactions based on the information available on the upstream enzyme in the enzyme-substrate reactions. This interaction can lead to conformational changes of the proteins. The interaction between proteins is identified by, immunoprecipitation, APEX, Bioplex, coIP, BioID, and TurboID methods.
* coIP
* APEX
* bioID
* bioplex


### Peptide enrichment 
* antibody enrichments of modifications, e.g. lysine acetylation [@DOI:10.1002/pmic.201800123].
* TiO2 and Fe enrichment of phosphorylation
* Glycosylation
* SISCAPA
