## Peptide or Protein Enrichment

### Protein enrichment (e.g. for protein protein interactions)
* coIP
* APEX
* bioID
* bioplex
The endogenous ligand stimulates cell-surface receptors, and the conformational changes in the receptor leads to a cascade of several signaling events. Which leads to molecular association/ protein-protein interaction. These interactions occur when two proteins directly interact with each other or when the proteins are present in complexes. This interaction lead to many conformational changes of the proteins. The interaction between proteins and subcellular localization of the proteins can be identified by immunoprecipitation, APEX, Bioplex, coIP, BioID, and TurboID methods.

### Peptide enrichment 
* antibody enrichments of modifications, e.g. lysine acetylation [@DOI:10.1002/pmic.201800123].
* TiO2 and Fe enrichment of phosphorylation
* Glycosylation
* SISCAPA
