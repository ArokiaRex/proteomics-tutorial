## Protein Extraction {.page_break_before}

Discussion of methods for protein extraction and solubilizaition. 


1. Choice of Lysis buffer
Most common surfactants such as Urea, Triton X, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) are used for cell lysis prior to mass spectrometry analysis.
* Urea can cause chemical modifications 
* SDS and SDC 
3. chemicals to avoid
4. removal of contaminations, Protein Precipitation
5. protein alkylation
* choices of reduction and alkylation reagents, TCEP/DTT/2BME, Chloroacetamide/iodoacetamide, n-ethyl maleimide
