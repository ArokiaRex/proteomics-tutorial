## Data Acquisition {.page_break_before}

Hybrid mass spectrometers used for modern proteome analysis offer the flexibility to collect data in many different ways. 
Data acquisition strategies differ in the sequence of precursor scans and fragment ion scans, and in how analytes are chose for MS/MS. 
Constant innovation to develop better and better data collection methods improves our view of the proteome, but the many method options might be confusing for newcomers. 
This section provides an overview of these general classes of data collection methods. 

Data acquisition strategies for proteomics fall into one of two general groups.
1. Data dependent acquisition, or DDA, in which the exact scan sequence in each analysis depends on the data that the mass spectrometer sees.
2. Data independent acquisition, or DIA, in which the exact scan sequence in each analysis DOES NOT depend on the data; the scans are the same whether you inject yeast peptides, human peptides, or a solvent blank.  

DDA and DIA can both be futher subdivided in to targeted and untargeted methods. That is, we have targeted DDA, untargeted DDA, targeted DIA, or untargeted DIA.


### DDA
Data dependent acquisition was an early advance that enabled collecting MS/MS spectra for analytes that meet certain conditions, such as a specified intensity threshold or a neutral loss [@DOI:10.1006/meth.1994.1031; @DOI:10.1021/ac00104a020]. 

#### Targeted DDA

#### Untargeted DIA


### DIA
Imagine the simplest method to operate a mass spectrometer is to have predefined scans that are collected for each analysis.

#### Targeted DIA

#### Untargeted DIA


New data collection strategies are worthless without computational methods to extract proteomic information.
