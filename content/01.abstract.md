## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Proteomics is the large scale study of protein structure and function from biological systems.  
"Shotgun proteomics" or "bottom-up proteomics" is the prevailing strategy for proteomics, which refers to the fragmentation of proteins into peptide pieces for easier analysis.
Mass spectrometry is used to detect peptides from proteome fragmentation.
Proteomics is commonly applied to identify and quantity as many proteins as possible from biological systems. 
Such quantitaive comparisons enable discovery of proteins that change between two or more conditions.
More diverse views of the proteome are also possible using mass spectrometry, for example we can measure protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and protein stability. 
To collect these diverse types of information, there are diverse strategies for proteome analysis, and each step in the workflow is tunable. 
The complexity and nuance of how proteomic methods differ may be difficulty to understand for new practitioners. 
Here, we provide a comprehensive tutorial of proteomics methods. 
Our tutorial starts with protein extraction and covers all steps ending with biological interpretation and study design. 
We expect that this work will serve as a basic resource for new practitioners of the field of shotgun or bottom-up proteomics.
