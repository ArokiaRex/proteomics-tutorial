## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Proteomics is the large scale study of protein structure and function from biological systems.  
"Shotgun proteomics" or "bottom-up proteomics" is the prevailing strategy for proteomics, in which proteins are hydrolyzed into peptide pieces for easier analysis.
Mass spectrometry is used to detect peptides.
Proteomics studies can be applied to diverse studies, for example to identify and quantity proteins, but also to study protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and protein stability. 
To collect these diverse types of information, there are diverse strategies for proteome analysis, and each step in the workflow is tunable. 
The complexity and nuance of how proteomic workflows differ may be difficult to understand for new practitioners. 
Here, we provide a comprehensive tutorial of proteomics methods. 
Our tutorial covers all necessary steps starting from protein extraction and ending with biological interpretation. 
We expect that this work will serve as a basic resource for new practitioners of the field of shotgun or bottom-up proteomics.
